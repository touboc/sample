# 通过废旧手机使用torrent

[1]手机电池报废，需要持续接电源才能使用
[2]按照废物利用，改造为torrent下载器

通过localsend传送文件，太慢啦。
6.3G的文件需要300分。
所以改为USB线直接连接手机的方式copy文件。

i have a tablet pc with android 7.0.
i want to take it as downloader for torrent.
i can automatically start a downloading when i send \*.torrent file to tablet-pc.
can you give me a solution to implement that.
if you need any addition clarification, feel free to ask.

==- **LibreTorrent** ==(Recommended): Open-source, lightweight, and has a built-in "Watch directory" feature.
    - **Setup:** Go to **Settings** > **Behavior** > **Watch directory** and select a folder on your tablet.

==**DriveSync** for Google Drive is better。==

- **Syncthing** (Best for Automation): Install Syncthing on both your main device and the tablet. Create a shared folder. When you save a torrent file to that folder on your PC, it instantly appears on the tablet, and the torrent client starts it immediately.

i  want to automatically start the libretorrent when the tablet-pc restarted.
can you tell me how to do it?
if you need any addition clarification, feel free to ask.

**[AutoStart App Manager] 
Option 2: Use MacroDroid (Most Reliable)
